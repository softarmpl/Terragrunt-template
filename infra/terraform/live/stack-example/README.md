# `stack-example` Configuration Overview 🌟

The `stack-example` symbolizes a distinct stack configuration within our Terragrunt framework. This setup underscores a hierarchical architecture designed to streamline and optimize configuration management, fostering modularity and efficient reuse.

## Configuration Files and Directories 📁

### `env.hcl` 🌱

- **Purpose**: Centralizes environment-specific configurations, like environment names or specific operational flags.
- **Usage**: Ensured consistency across child modules by including this file.

### `env.tfvars` 📝

- **Purpose**: Specifies Terraform variables unique to the environment, including resource configurations and features.
- **Usage**: Terraform automatically loads these during operations, tailoring the deployment to the environment needs.

### `global/` 🌍

This directory encompasses configurations for individual modules within the stack, adaptable across different regions like `us-east-1` or globally applicable settings.

#### `<module>/module.hcl` 🛠️

- **Purpose**: Harmonizes common module configurations, ensuring consistent application of settings such as provider versions and resource tags.
- **Usage**: Modules inherit these settings through their `terragrunt.hcl`, promoting shared configurations.

#### `<module>/terraform.tfvars` 🔧

- **Purpose**: Customizes the module's behavior with Terraform variables, affecting resources and provider setups.
- **Usage**: Directly influences the module's Terraform configuration, offering specific customizations.

#### `<module>/terragrunt.hcl` 💡

- **Purpose**: Acts as the core of the module's Terragrunt configuration, establishing connections to necessary Terraform code, remote state configurations, and operational hooks.
- **Usage**: Facilitates the execution of Terraform commands enriched by Terragrunt's features, like dependency resolution and pre/post hooks.

### `region.hcl` and `region.tfvars` 🌏

- **Purpose**: Tailors configurations to specific cloud regions or datacenters, enhancing deployments across geographical locations.
- **Usage**: Modules requiring region-specific setups include these files, ensuring deployments are region-aware.

### `stack.hcl` and `stack.tfvars` 📚

- **Purpose**: Broadcasts stack-wide configurations and Terraform variables across all environments and regions, ensuring uniform application.
- **Usage**: Provides a foundation for `env.hcl` or module configurations, assuring alignment with stack-level standards.

### `terragrunt.hcl` 🚀

- **Purpose**: Serves as the pinnacle of the stack's Terragrunt configuration, orchestrating module deployments and overarching configurations.
- **Usage**: Manages cross-environment dependencies, remote state, and other comprehensive concerns through Terragrunt commands.

## Summary 📖

The `stack-example` directory illustrates Terragrunt and Terraform's synergy in orchestrating sophisticated cloud infrastructures. By structuring configurations in a hierarchical manner, teams are empowered to adapt to diverse deployment scenarios while adhering to DRY principles for an efficient and manageable codebase.
